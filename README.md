# animal-lover-project

## Description

This program will allow users to look up available dogs for adoption by dog breed through an API search. From there the users are able to click on a specific dog breed and view a modal of information on an available dog of that breed. The modal includes the available dogâ€™s name, status, age, size, primary and secondary breed, and photo. The user can then save the available dog as a favorite, which is put into local storage and later displayed on the favorites page or they are able to close the modal, click the breed again, and are then presented with a different available dog.


## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you'll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework (BONUS for using something other than Bootstrap).

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)
