      <h3>Happy Home, Happy Pet!</h3>
      <p>Once youâ€™ve decided on the pet who will best fit your household, create separate areas for your new and current pets. This will allow them to have their own spaces to relax without fighting over resources. In the beginning, you may need to place baby gates to keep the areas truly separate to introduce the pets slowly. For example, cats often need more time than dogs to adapt to change, so outfit a spare bedroom or office for your new cat. Place a litter box, food and water dishes, bedding, and climbing tower for maximum comfort, and allow your cats to sniff each other under the door until they appear comfortable with each other.</p>
