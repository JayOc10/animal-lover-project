          <h3>Be in the Know!</h3>
          <p>
            Bringing home a new pet is an exciting time, but it can also cause
            an upheaval in your household. Before you welcome home that adorable
            pet you found in an animal shelter or rescue, take the time to
            prepare your home, your family, and your current pet for your new
            addition.

          <h3>Happy Home, Happy Pet!</h3>
          <p>
            Once youâ€™ve decided on the pet who will best fit your household,
            create separate areas for your new and current pets. This will allow
            them to have their own spaces to relax without fighting over
            resources. In the beginning, you may need to place baby gates to
            keep the areas truly separate to introduce the pets slowly. For
            example, cats often need more time than dogs to adapt to change, so
            outfit a spare bedroom or office for your new cat. Place a litter
            box, food and water dishes, bedding, and climbing tower for maximum
            comfort, and allow your cats to sniff each other under the door
            until they appear comfortable with each other.

          Every year, approximately 8 to 12 millions animals enter animal
          shelters nationwide, and approximately 5 to 9 million pets are
          euthanized. Currently, the average length of stay in a shelter is
          eight days, however there are many cases in which animals stay as long
          as eight to nine months before adoption. Animals are often given uo or
          found on the streets and are unable to get the care or family they
          need because shelters are too full. Our shelters need your help so
          that every animal can get the proper care and attention they need.
